# zssn

ZSSN (Zombie Survival Social Network) - Frontend
Problem Description
The world as we know it has fallen into an apocalyptic scenario. A laboratory-made virus is transforming human beings and animals into zombies, hungry for fresh flesh.

You, as a zombie resistance member (and the last survivor who knows how to code), was designated to develop a system to share resources between non-infected humans.

Requirements
You will develop a website that consumes a REST API which will store information about the survivors, as well as the resources they own.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
